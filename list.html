            <p> Ask any local about the best point of interest in Lucknow to kick-off a city tour and
            most of them will suggest Bara Imambara. That’s how culturally and historically
            significant and famed this place is. The first important thing to know about it, which
            you may also have guessed from its name, is that it is huge. And, the second one is
            that it is absolutely stunning.
            The construction of this wondrous piece of architecture is said to have started in
            1785 when Awadh and its surrounding areas where hit by a devastating famine. Thus,
            for the purpose of offering employment to locals in this time of need, the ruler of
            the region ordered that this structure to be built. The construction went on for as
            long as the famine lasted, which is almost a decade. Another intriguing fact about
            this place is that its central hall is believed by many to be the world’s largest vaulted
            chamber. Shahi Baoli and Bhool-Bhulaiyan are among its highlights

            and certainly has
            no less touristy appeal than any other tourist place in and near Lucknow. Also
            referred to as Hussainabad Imambara, it was built between 1837 and 1842, about
            four decades after the completion of Bara Imambara. Its gilded dome, turrets and
            intricate calligraphy evokes a “wow” on every sight. Read also – Things to do in

            It was built per the orders of Muhammad Ali Shah, the third ruler of Lucknow, who
            today, along with the several members of his family, rests in tombs within the
            imambara itself. Mughals, during their centuries-long reign over most parts of the
            Indian subcontinent erected a plethora of buildings that are present even today.
            However, Chota Imambara has to be one of the most magnificent structures any
            Mughal emperor ever built in India. So, do not skip this place during your city tour
            in Lucknow.

            Aside from being a place of worship, The Umananda temple is also a pleasurable exception to the typical
            places of worship. Devoid of the cacophony of forceful religion, this place has a serene environment which
            makes you want to sit down for a while and absorb the beauty of the place.

            <H1>3) <mark>BRITISH REGIDENCY:</mark></H1> British Residency may not be one of the best preserved monuments
            in Lucknow, but
            it is undeniably an important part of its history. Hence, a must visit for every history
            buff during a Lucknow trip. In 1857, when the city found itself at one of the major
            centres of rebellion uprisings against the cruel British rule, this place became home
            to about 3000 British people.
            The complex in itself is made decades older than that. It was actually built in the
            latter half of the 18th century to provide accommodation to the British guests of the
            regional rulers. Owing to its intriguing past and the crucial role it played in the city’s
            history, it has been declared a protected monument by the Archaeological Survey of
            India (ASI).

            Lucknow which is often
            skipped by tourists for the more prominent ones. Though much of it is in a
            dilapidated state, it still offers a glimpse into the royal lifestyle of the past monarchs
            of the region. The construction of the several buildings of the complex started on
            the orders of Nawab Wajid Ali Shah in the year 1848. After the completion, the
            buildings that flank the three sides of the Kaiserbagh quadrangle were turned into
            quarters for the women of Wajid Ali Shah’s harem.
            Although there are several structures in the complex that are quite impressive, the
            one that stands out is the splendid Safed Baradari – a marvel built with white stone.
            You might also be surprised to learn the fact that this building situated at the centre
            of the complex was once paved with silver.

            minutes at Rumi
            Darwaza. It is one of the finest pieces of architecture in the city of Lucknow. It is
            believed to be identical to a structure that once stood in the city of Constantinople
            in Turkey during the ancient times. Thus, the 60 feet tall structure is also often
            referred to as Turkish Gate.
            In the olden days, it marked as the entrance to the Old Lucknow city, but today it
            stands as the symbol of the city. It is one of the many structures that were built by
            Nawab Asaf-ud-Daula during the famine of the late 18th century to help the locals.
            If you want to capture the best sights of this giant structure, then visit during the
            night when it looks absolutely gorgeous.

            Manzil. The building
            derives its name from its most prominent feature which is an umbrella-shaped dome
            at its top. Another highlight of this place is its architecture which shows glimpses
            of various styles. The most apparent one of these is the European style which can
            be witnessed in the numerous features of the building.
            Ghazi-ud-Din Haider, a former Nawab of the region, is the one who is said to have
            begun the construction of the complex. However, the monarch died before it could
            be completed. It was then Nasir-ud-Din Haider, his son who took the charge and
            finished the project. Today, it has been turned into a government office, although
            its old charm is still a treat for the eyes.

            these are built
            as per not just one or two, but several styles of architecture from all over the world.
            While the above monuments reflected Mughal, Hindu, European and other styles,
            Dilkusha Kothi is here to show you the magnificence of the Baroque style of
            architecture.
            Saadat Ali Khan, during his rule in the 19th century, constructed this building, which
            is a complete replica of Seaton Delavel, an English country house built in 1721. The
            sprawling greenery surrounding the edifice adds to its charm.

                landscape of Lucknow since 1887 when it was built to commemorate the arrival of
                Sir George Couper who served as the first Lieutenant Governor of the United

                Masjid is another sight
                for you to explore during a visit to the city. And not just that! It is also an important
                spiritual centre, a place of worship which remains swamped with devout Shia
                Muslims during all auspicious occasions.
                Started in 1837 when Muhammad Ali Shah was in power, the construction of the
                building was derailed at the demise of the ruler. However, Nawab Malika Janah took
                the charge to make sure that the project was completed. Today, the mosque stands
                as one of the finest examples of the Mughal architecture in the city of Lucknow. A
                must see here are giant pillars that have Jain and Hindu carvings on them.
                If you have explored all the above-mentioned tourist attractions but still feel a little
                thirst to learn about history, then you can head over to the State Museum. Do not
                take it to be an ordinary, run-of-the-mill museum. It succeeds when other historical
                landmarks in the city fail to give you an insight into the rich past of Lucknow and
                its people. It is home to a host of artistic, archaeological, anthropological and other
                artefacts.
